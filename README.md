I recently completed a rigorous 16-week, full-time software development program at Makers Academy, known for its highly competitive selection process and a curriculum that places a strong emphasis on Emotional Intelligence.

During the course, I gained hands-on experience in building full-stack applications using a wide range of technologies and frameworks, including JavaScript, Express, React, Node, MongoDB, Jest, Cypress, Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, and RSpec.

One of the highlights of my experience was working effectively in team settings, where we followed agile methodologies. This involved daily stand-up meetings, collaborative planning sessions, sprint-based project management, pair programming, and retrospectives. These experiences not only enhanced my skills at working in a team but also gave me an opportunity to develop as an individual.
