## About Me

I am a recent graduate of Makers Academy with a passion for coding that was sparked by intriguing simulations of Slime Moulds, The Game Of Life's computer simulations, and the captivating Mandelbrot set. This curiosity drives me to pursue a fulfilling career in technology.

Throughout my journey, I've gained diverse experiences across various industries including food, construction, marketing, and even running my own successful T-shirt and mug business during lockdown. I'm excited to bring this rich background to my new role in tech.
