## Cameron Murison

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what excites you about tech.
I am a recent graduate of *Makers Academy* who fell in love with coding after watching strange videos of simulations of Slime Molds, seeing how computers can be simulated inside The Game Of Life, and seeing The Mandelbrot set for the first time.

## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Team Work
Having worked in a wide range of jobs in varied industries, I've had the chance to work with all sorts of people. In doing so I've learned how to effectivley communicate and work together as part of a team to get the job done, no matter the circumstance. I enjoy working with others and find that the work becomes easier and better when working in a team, especially when that team all has a clear goal and are dedicated to reaching it.

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Another skill


## Education

#### Makers Academy (March 2023 - June 2023)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Your University / College (start_date to end_date)

- Subject, any specialisms
- Grade
- Other cool stuff

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies
In my free time I like to play my guitar, read about greek myths or listen to audiobooks about Dorian Gray's demise. I also enjoy playing games, and getting overpowered and emasculated whilst doing BJJ.
